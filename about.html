  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <img src="about.jpg" alt="Natalia Kay">

  <p>
    I'm Natalia — warm, engaging, and effortlessly charming.
    I bring an outgoing, bubbly energy that instantly puts you at ease,
    paired with a sensual, seductive presence that lingers long after our time together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether we’re sharing cocktails over candlelight, enjoying a refined dinner,
    or escaping together for a private getaway, I pride myself on being attentive,
    playful, and genuinely present. I love good conversation, laughter,
    and creating an experience that feels natural, indulgent, and unmistakably exclusive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based primarily in <strong>Las Vegas</strong> and the
    <strong>Washington DC / VA area</strong>, I am available for select arrangements worldwide.
    Discretion, elegance, and chemistry are always assured.
