<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="about.jpg" alt="Natalia Kay">

<p>
Naturally outgoing and genuinely warm, I’m known for an easy smile, engaging conversation,
and a presence that instantly puts people at ease. I value laughter, connection, and
the kind of chemistry that feels effortless.
</p>

<p>
Beneath my bubbly nature lies a sensual, seductive side — subtle, confident, and intentional.
I understand the rhythm of attraction: when to tease, when to listen, and when to let the moment linger.
</p>

<p>
Based primarily in <strong>Las Vegas</strong> and the <strong>Washington DC / VA area</strong>,
I travel frequently and am available worldwide. Date nights, elegant dinners, fly-me-to-you
experiences — passport ready and short-notice friendly.
